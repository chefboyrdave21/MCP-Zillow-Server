# MCP Server Zillow - Code Review and Testing PRD

## Overview
The MCP Server Zillow project requires a comprehensive code review, testing, and validation process to ensure it functions correctly as a Model Context Protocol server. The server provides tools for searching Zillow properties and retrieving detailed property information.

## Core Requirements

### Server Implementation
- Server must be properly configured with name, version, and capabilities
- Server must connect to transport correctly
- Server must handle tool registration and execution
- Server must implement proper error handling
- Server must follow TypeScript best practices and maintain type safety

### Tools Implementation
- ZILLOW_SEARCH_TOOL must validate and process location parameter correctly
- ZILLOW_PROPERTY_DETAILS_TOOL must validate and process zpid parameter correctly
- Both tools must handle errors appropriately
- Tools must return properly typed responses

### Testing Requirements
- Comprehensive test coverage for server initialization and configuration
- Test cases for tool registration and listing
- Test cases for tool execution with valid and invalid parameters
- Error handling test cases
- Transport initialization and handling tests
- Mock implementation for Zillow API calls
- Type safety validation in tests

### Code Quality
- Fix all TypeScript linter errors
- Ensure proper typing throughout the codebase
- Follow consistent code style and best practices
- Proper error handling and logging
- Clear and maintainable code structure

## Success Criteria
1. All tests pass successfully
2. No TypeScript linter errors
3. Server initializes and configures correctly
4. Tools execute and handle errors as expected
5. Code is well-documented and maintainable
6. Type safety is maintained throughout
7. Error handling is comprehensive and user-friendly

## Technical Constraints
- Must use TypeScript
- Must follow MCP protocol specifications
- Must maintain compatibility with MCP SDK
- Must handle Zillow API integration properly
